# MATL
A programming language based on MATLAB and suitable for code golfing

The compiler works in Matlab R2015b. Probably in older versions too, except for some specific functions.

Installation: unpack the compressed file to a folder, and make that folder part of Matlab's path.

Test: running `matl 10:t!*` from the MATLAB command window should produce a decimal multiplication table.

Usage: see specification document.
