# MATL
A programming language based on MATLAB and suitable for code golfing

The compiler works in MATLAB R2015b. Probably in older versions too, except for some specific functions.

Installation: unpack the compressed file to a folder, and make that folder part of MATLAB's path.

Test: running `matl 10:t!*` from the MATLAB command window should produce a decimal multiplication table.

Usage: see [specification document](https://github.com/lmendo/MATL/blob/master/MATL_spec.pdf).
